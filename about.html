		<!-- General overview -->
		<p>Niskayuna D&amp;D is a teen-driven organization based in Niskayuna. We first established ourselves at a club in the middle school in 2015, after discovering the shared passion for the game among a few of our friends. Since then we have grown, reaching 13 members at its height.</p>
		<!-- Games -->
		<p>We have mostly played Dungeons and Dragons (surprise!) during the history of the group, however this is not all that we have played. On occassion, we also played card games such as Yu-Gi-Oh! and Magic: The Gathering&trade;. Earlier we also played a version of G.U.R.P.S. While we would be willing to try other tabletop RPGs, such as Pathfinder, we prefer Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edtion, since we have the physical books for those. Additionally, while not being a part of the group per se, we often play computer games together.</p>
		<!-- Setting -->
		<p>We do not always meet in the same place, however we do have an established hoster that hosts each session at his house. We meet every sunday from 1pm to 5pm, and attendance is not mandatory but highly encouraged, as it is difficult to follow a story if you only know half of it.</p>
		<!-- Inclusivity -->
		<p>We have people from not just Niskayuna in our group as well. Furthermore, despite what you might expect, we are not entirely male, and have a couple female members. I personally feel like this shouldn't have to be said, but those of any ethnicity, nationality, religion, etc are welcome no matter what.</p>
		<!-- About me, I guess -->
		<p>By this point, you might be wondering who I am. For a long time, I was the head Dungeon Master of the group, however I recently abdicated for the sake of variety, and in my newfound free time I decided to practice my coding skills on this website! Oh, and it was also a project in Computer Science 1... :)</p>
